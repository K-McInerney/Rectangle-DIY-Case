# Rectangle-DIY-Case
Please let me know if you guys need anything else, very new to 3d modeling but I think this came out fairly well. Also change anything you need too, this is far from perfect and would love any input.
- Fixing the swtichplate soon, its way to thick right now.
- Usb-C Port is a little oversized right now
- The connection holes for the two front halves aren't perfect, the M6 screw fits but the ones I picked up were a bit too long to fit in the cutout farthest from the USB-C. I'll try and raise the holes as well since i wasnt able to fit the nuts on easily.
- I am in the middle of printing out the backplate and testing that shortly
